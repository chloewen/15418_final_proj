<h1>Parallel Unblock Me Solver</h1>
<p>Team Members: Sangita Setlur & Chloe Wen</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>We are going to implement an optimized solver for the game Unblock Me. We plan on using both CUDA and openMP to implement parallelization and will compare the results of these implementations. </p>
<p>We will also optimizie our implementation by using alpha-beta pruning to reduce the size of our game tree. </p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Unblock Me is a puzzle where a user is given a board of blocks, with one horizontal red block on the very left of the board and a hole on that row on the right wall. The user's goal is to shift the other blocks around to create a path for the red block to go through the hole. </p>
